# Week 4

[Hours spent: ~17h](<https://github.com/Darake/zip-zop/blob/master/documentation/timesheet.md#week-4>)

### Progress

* Finished Huffman decompression
* Made a simple GUI
* Replaced HashMap usage with array implementations
* Started working on min heap implementation
* Started implementation documentation
* Started performance testing

This week I finished the compression program with Huffman coding and a simple GUI. I also found out that my HashMap usages were not needed because of a possible array implementation.



### Challenges & Questions

While testing some real world files on the application, I noticed that some files types did not compress at all. These include JPG and PDF. Is it cause they already use Huffman or a similar compression? I was also wondering if the UI has to have tests written as well or can they be excluded from the coverage report, like in 'ohjelmistotekniikka'?



### What's next?

I'm not sure of how much I can put time into the project next week. If possible, i'd like to finish the min heap  implementation and start looking into the Lempel Ziv algorithm.
