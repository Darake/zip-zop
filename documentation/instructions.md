# Instructions

### Getting started

Before downloading the application, Java 11 is needed for running the jar file.

After that, download the latest application version from [here](https://github.com/Darake/zip-zop/releases).

### Usage

Using the application is simple. Start by, simply double clicking the jar file or entering `java -jar /path/to/file.jar` in the console, where '/path/to/' is the path to the file from your working directory and 'file.jar' is the name of the jar file. A simple user interface should appear.

First, lets select a file by clicking 'Select file'. A file chooser should pop up.

Select the file to be compressed and the click the 'Compress' button. Now a file saver should pop up.

Choose the location and the name of the compressed file and click save. If the file is large, the application may have seem crashed. Most likely tho, it's just compressing your file. The compression is ready when the file saver window disappears.

Decompressions works in the same way. First you select the decompressed file. Then you press 'Decompress' and choose where to save the decompressed file.
