# Week 1

### Progress

* Started documentation by creating a software requirements specification, timesheet and a readme
* Started the project itself

This week was mostly spent on researching different project possibilities. I ended up choosing a compression project. I researched on Huffman coding, LZ77 and Deflate a bit. A lot of it is still unclear but the goal is to learn on the go.



### Challenges

By the quick research it was a bit unclear what data structures is needed for building this application.



### What's next?

The next step is to read about Huffman coding more in depth and start coding.
