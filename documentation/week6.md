### Progress

* Finished min heap
* Created a stack implementation
* Finished implementation- and testing documentation

This week I finished my min heap implementation, created a stack implementation and put them in use. In addition to finishing data structures, I finished the documentation for implementation and testing.



### What's next?

Next week I will make an user guide. If time permits, I will look into implementing a Lempel Ziv algorithm.
