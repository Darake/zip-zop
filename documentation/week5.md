# Week 5

Hours spent: 0h

[Code Review 1](https://github.com/VirtualAkseli/UniBun/issues/1)

### Progress

This week unfortunately I didn't have time to do anything other than the code review.

### Questions

At the moment my average compression is around 63% of the original file size. [On here](https://github.com/TiraLabra/2019_alkukesa/blob/master/sivut/aiheet.md#tiedon-tiivistys) it was said that the target compression is 40-60% of the original file size. I thought that I had time to do a Deflate implementation but I might not have that time. Can I still pass the course with only a Huffman compression and 63% compression of original size?

### What's next?

Next week i'll finish my min heap implementation. In addition, I will finish the documentation for testing and implementation.
